      "text": "C++ is essential for Arduino because the framework is built on it, and its core functions rely on C++. It enables object-oriented programming, efficient memory management, and high performance, which are crucial for microcontrollers with limited resources. Many Arduino libraries use C++ classes, so understanding the language helps with customization and extending functionality. While basic projects require minimal C++ knowledge, mastering it allows for more advanced and efficient programming."
