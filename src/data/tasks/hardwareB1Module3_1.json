      "text": "**Schematics** are graphical representations of circuits. They use symbols for each component (e.g., a zigzag line for resistors, a triangle for transistors) to show how components are connected. These diagrams help engineers and technicians design, analyze, and troubleshoot circuits."

      "text": "A **breadboard** is a tool used for prototyping electronic circuits without soldering. It consists of a grid of holes that are electrically connected in rows and columns, allowing components to be placed and connected easily. Components are inserted into the breadboard to create temporary circuits for testing."
