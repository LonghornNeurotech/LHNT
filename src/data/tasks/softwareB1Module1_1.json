      "text": "**Python** is an essential programming language for software development in neurotechnology. It is easy to learn and use, making it a great tool for processing neural data, building machine learning models, and automating research tasks. With Python, you can develop skills in data analysis, signal processing, and algorithm design, which are key for working with brain-computer interfaces, neuroimaging, and neural simulations. Its libraries, like NumPy, SciPy, and TensorFlow, help with handling large datasets and applying AI to neuroscience problems. Knowing Python allows you to quickly test ideas, analyze brain signals, and create software for neurotech applications."
