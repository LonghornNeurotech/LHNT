      "text": "Statistics play a crucial role in both software development and brain-computer interface (BCI) technology by enabling the analysis of large datasets and improving decision-making. In software, statistical methods help identify patterns, optimize algorithms, and ensure reliability through data-driven testing. For BCIs, statistics are essential for analyzing brain signal data, calibrating devices, and improving the accuracy of decoding user intentions. By applying statistical models, these fields can make more informed, evidence-based advancements."
