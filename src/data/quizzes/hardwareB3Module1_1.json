    "question": "Why are the power rails (buses) on a breadboard typically marked with red and black (or blue) lines?",
    "options": [
      "To indicate where LEDs should be placed",
      "To help identify the positive and negative connections for power distribution",
      "To show where to insert integrated circuits",
      "To separate different circuit components"

    "question": "What is the advantage of using solid-core wire over stranded wire in a breadboard?",
    "options": [
      "Solid-core wire is more flexible and bends easily",
      "Solid-core wire is easier to push into the breadboard and holds connections better",
      "Stranded wire is too thin to conduct electricity",
      "Solid-core wire prevents short circuits"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Solid-core wire is easier to push into the breadboard and holds connections better"

    "question": "How should an integrated circuit (IC) be placed on a breadboard?",
    "options": [
      "Across the power rails for maximum stability",
      "Straddling the middle gap so each row is connected separately",
      "With all pins inserted into a single row",
      "At the very edge of the breadboard for easy access"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": "Straddling the middle gap so each row is connected separately"
